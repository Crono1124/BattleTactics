# BattleTactics
 BattleTech Mod

  I wanted to create a mod in Battletech that enriches the vanilla experience while providing a slightly higher difficulty level. In order to provide a new gaming experience:
  #### +weapons and units have been added that focus on difficulty by impacting the Heat, structure, and stability of player mechs. 
  #### +Light to Medium mechs can be utilized throguhout end game content without just fielding an all assault lance.
  #### +Light mechs should be able to utilize weapons to disable (Destroy) the weapon systems of heavier mechs.
  #### +Larger mechs only = survivability now, not unlimited firepower.
  #### +Salvaging a mech is no longer an accidental act. Weapons have been created to assist in salvaging actions.
  #### +A faction is planned to be introduced that specalizes in mech salvage... Yay Pirates! 
  
  
  (At this time no DLC is required for this MOD as I have not edited any DLC mechs YET.)

# Current Changes:

### Global accuracy changes:

+All units will now only gain +1% accuracy per gunnery stat increase vice the original 2.5%. This prevents the constant 95% hit chance without the use of tactics (Higher Ground)

 +All LRM Accuracy lowered. LRM missile spam should be just that... Spam. Lobbing 40+ missiles from thousands of feet away should not all impact with perfect accuracy. This was implemented by lowering LRM missile accuracy modifier by 3. (Still in balance testing phase.)
 
### An increased Player VS AI Difficulty:

 +Allow the AI to utilize more alpha strikes. Unless the AI will overheat, or has a less than ~10% chance of hitting you. Expect the AI to give you the full business with every possible shot. What you do to them, They will now do to you :) (*Requires slight tweaks... AI Logic still prefers to single shot or punch but has improved)

 ### New Ammo Types:

 Chemical Laser Ammo: Quantity per box in testing.

 Cluster Missile (IMPACT): Ammo is heavy, limited in quantity.

 Heavy Machine Gun Ammo: Large inventory size, Low Quantity per container, 1 ton per container.

 Disrupter Rifle Ammo: Energy Weapon / Requires Ammo cells? Testing in progress

 Salvage Rifle Ammo: Low Quantity per box, Large box size per 1 ton

 Armor Piercing Missile Ammo: Low Quantity per box, Large box size per 1 ton

 ### New Weapons:

 +Heavy Machine Gun: No Heat, Medium Range, Heavy Ammo, Large Container, Low Weight (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Chemical Laser Array: Low heat laser; uses chemical laser ammo; causes slight heat damage on hit; hits multiple locations (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Chemical Large Laser: Low heat laser; uses chemical laser ammo; causes slight heat damage on hit; (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Chemical Medium Laser: Low heat laser; uses chemical laser ammo; causes slight heat damage on hit; (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Chemical Small Laser: Low heat laser; uses chemical laser ammo; causes slight heat damage on hit; (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Long Range Energy Missile: high heat, LRM 5 (Stock, +, ++ variants)

 +Long Range Cluster Missile: Low Damage, high instability damage missile. (Comes in 3 sizes Small, Medium, and Large.)

 +Energy Disrupter Rifle: Little Damage, Low Heat Damage, Extreme Critical Chance. Applies Sensors Impaired status effect.

 +Salvage Rifle: Low Heat, Low Damage, High instability damage. (Used by Raider mech types)

 +SRM Armor Piercing Missiles: Low Heat on shot, Low / moderate Damage on hit, Structure Damage on Hit, Reduced Critical chance by 50%.

 ### New Mech Variants: (All currently in Random Encounters only. Not yet available in stores)

 Armored Cicada - CDA-4D: Includes XXL Engine: Utilizes Fully armored, Quad HMG; Quad High Dmg support MGs... and a whole lot of explody bits. (Possible Starting Mech)

 Firestarter - FS9-DD: Pair of LBX-2 ++, and High Damage medium Lasers (Possible Starting Mech)

 Grashopper GHR-5C: Chemical Laser variant

 Grasshopper GHR-5M: Energy Missile Variant

 Locust_LCT-1T: Armor Piercing Variant (Possible Starting Mech)

 Jenner JR7-1C: Quad Chemical Lasers (Great for high heat Biome); Twin SRM4 Armor Piercing. (Possible Starting Mech)

 Enforcer ENF-7T: Lawman Variant: Fully Armored; Anti Stability Mech. Snub PPC High stability damage; 3 Long Range Energy Missiles; 1 Impact Cannon; 2 Melee Stability damage mods (Non-Removable); +3 Hit Defense Gyro. (Possible Starting Mech)

 Light to Medium Mechs should now have a purpose throughout the entire game with the above additions. AP Missiles are perfect for destroying enemy weapon systems and components on heavier mechs.

### Balance Adjustments:

+All new units added into all random encounters

# Coming Soon:
 
### New faction: Pirate Salvagers (WIP) (*Pending Implementation*)
 +Add mech variants specific to black market pirates. These pirates operate under the mantra: "Save the metal kill the meat." (*Pending Implementation*)
 Weapons:

 ### Ammo Types:

 +CASE Ammo for all weapon types: Same tonnage, less explody, larger inventory slot requirements

 +1/2 Ton Ammo Containers for all weapons?
 
 ### Mech Variants:

 Kintaro

 Dragon

 Zues

###  Vehicle Types:

 +Armor Piercing Missile Carrier: Low Damage Armor piercing missile loadout; High priority Target. Take it out or expect to spend a lot of time in the mechbay repairing components (Or whole mech sections if you do not use CASE Ammo)

 +Salvager Tank: High stability damage vehicles. Cockpit mods may save your life.

 +Cluster Missile Carrier: Used by Raider faction to save the metal :) Cockpit mods may save your life.

### Balance Adjustments:

 +Rarity of Pulse Lasers to be adjusted

 +All Lostek weapons to be added to all shops with high rarity

 +Stock PPC Damage / heat balance to be applied

 +Stock Large Laser and + Variants to be balanced
 
  +All Head shot chances reduced against all targets. This will lower the possibility of getting random head shots from any weapons fire Unless the enemy is on higher elevation than you. If there is an elevation imbalance the mech with the higher ground gets a bonus to head shot percentages. (*Pending Implementation*)
  (--I want to look into lowering the chance of head shots from the side as well. I feel like if you want to shoot somebody in the head you should have to do it from head on. )

# Misc. Notes

  +Mechs with (XXL) Engines have critical slots permanently occupied on left and right torso sections to adjust for decreased weight. These critical slots are considered explosive to the location only. This configuration is unique to mech variants and can not be transferred to other mechs via mechlab.
  
  +Mech chassis that come with Gyro's or rangefinders pre-installed will not allow them to be removed. Similar in fashion to Warhammer and Phoenix Hawk Variants. 

 After reading above you'll quickly realize most of these adjustments are not in line with Table Top or anything else for that matter. My goal is to just create a fun experience for as many people as I can.

### Installation Notes:
 
 Currently the mod uses MODTEK to install and is functional with Battletech version 1.9.1 . I'm hoping to have a good baseline version available by Sunday. All creative inputs welcome!
 
 **The Mod folder needs to be called, "BattleTactics" when placed in your ModTeK Mod Folder.**

 Disclaimer: *I am not an expert modder, just an enthusiast of the game.
